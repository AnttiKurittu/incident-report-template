# 3 Timeline of events

> [HELPER] Write a sub-chapter explaining the two following timelines, or choose one to structure your report around. There are two distinct timelines that can be used to describe the chronological order of events. The timelines run parallel, but describe different things. In cases, where it is reasonable to combine these timelines, that should be done but beware of complexity. Any sufficiently complicated attack chain intermixed with the investigative actions will quickly render the timeline unreadable.
> 
> Consider adding a graphical overview timeline that shows the main events on a visual line. This will serve as a timeline summary and make it easy to understand the order of the unfolding events. The detailed timeline can be presented as a table that contains columns for a timestamp, event, the affected resource and who was either responsible or acting on the issue.
> The investigation timeline should describe the steps taken by investigators and other personnel who were working on identifying, containing, eradicating and recovering from this incident. This timeline typically contains things like shutting down machines, resetting credentials, removing malware and restoring backups.
>
> Additionally, you can add a graphical high-level timeline showing the most significant events of the investigation to summarize the table.
> 
> The next main chapter, Investigation description, is where the investigation story is told. Timeline entries should be short, concise and clear.
