# 5 Conclusions and recommendations

> This chapter carries the conclusions of the investigator. A good way to approach the conclusions is to take the original research questions and attempt to answer them based on the facts uncovered by the investigation. Questions that no definitive answer was found for should also be addressed here, and the explanation for why the question could not be answered should be found in the investigation limitations chapter.
> 
> This is by it's nature a subjective chapter, and care should be taken when considering cause and effect, certainty and especially culpability. Refer to the general style guide to ensure statements of certainty follow a defined pattern. 
> 
> The conclusions should serve as a neutral, technical explanation of the incident. Pointing fingers or talking about individual people instead of user accounts is not good practice, and might lead to undesirable consequences. The job of the incident responder is not to figure out which admin made a mistake and where, but to document the technical facts in the environment where the incident happened. When describing someone doing something, describe what an _account_ did instead of what a _user_ did. This is technically factual and can be proven with forensic evidence.
## Recommendations

> The recommendations chapter is based on your conclusions, expertise as a security professional, and should focus on how to prevent similar incidents in the future. This is the chapter where the failures of security that lead to the incident in the first place can be corrected. The recommendations should be grounded on concrete findings and be specific enough to be used as points of entry to further development. General recommendations like "do security better" are not useful, but actionable recommendations like "monitor and block open RDP ports on the network" are.

>Remember, that these conclusions and recommendations will most likely be read very carefully and discussed in security steering groups and other leadership decision-making forums. If they are easy to understand and possible to implement without massive investment, they will most likely be executed on.
