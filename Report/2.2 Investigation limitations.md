# 2.2 Investigation limitations

<p class="helper"> All investigations have limitations - logs go back only so far, endpoints can not be acquired for forensic analysis, there is time pressure and sometimes the customer sets a time limit on how long an investigation can go on.<br>
<br>
In this chapter, outline the main limitations of the investigation and explain their effect on the depth and detail of the report. Describe which logs were not available, or how an insufficient retention time limited looking back in time. If devices were not available due to lack of remote tools or physical access, describe that.<br>
<br>
This chapter can also hold recommendations on ensuring that necessary digital evidence is available when it is needed. Log time retention is a common problem in DFIR investigations, so describe which logs are insufficiently retained.
<br>
<br>Suggestions for log time retention can and should be derived from common standards. One easy to remember option is PCI DSS, which requires that logs are available 90 days indexed and searchable, and retained 365 days in cold storage. This can provide a good guideline for making recommendations to your customer going forward.<br>
<br>
Lack of internal resources is also a limitation, but be careful not to disclose too much when describing lack of personnel on the service provider's side.</p>
