# 2 Executive Summary

> [HELPER] A clear and concise summary of the event, excluding technical details unless absolutely necessary. The executive summary should be written for a business audience with no assumed technical expertise. The summary should be written last, after all other reporting is done and the investigation is concluded. The target length of the executive summary is less than one printed page. It should encapsulate the report's purpose, key findings, and actionable recommendations without delving into technical jargon. 
>
> Start by clearly stating the most critical information, such as the nature of the cybersecurity incident, its impact on the organization, and the steps taken to mitigate it. For example, instead of detailing every technical aspect, you might say, "Our investigation revealed a data breach that compromised sensitive information of 500 users, prompting immediate remediation actions and enhanced security protocols." 
>
> This approach ensures that decision-makers can quickly grasp the essence of the report and understand the implications for the organization. Additionally, structure the executive summary to include essential sections such as key findings, incident summaries, and remediation recommendations. It is also beneficial to include metrics like time from detection to resolution and possible economic impacts where they are clearly measurable.
