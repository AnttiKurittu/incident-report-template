# 2.3 Investigation goals and targets

> [HELPER] The goals of the investigation are the outcomes that the investigation aimed to reach. These are best formulated in the form of research questions that can then be answered in the final conclusions. Forming the investigation goals into research questions helps to guide the investigation and keep the goal clear - this limits the risk that an investigation will dive into rabbit holes and lose focus of what the main goal is.
> 
> Research questions can be augmented with subquestions, and these should be reiterated in investigation sync meetings.
> 
> Example investigation questions:

## Investigation research questions

- What was the initial point of entry to the network?
	- Subquestion: What method was used to gain initial access?
- Which credentials are suspected of being compromised?
- Are there any signs of data exfiltration?
- Was personal data compromised?
	- Subquestion: How many records were suspected or confirmed compromised?
	- Subquestion: Which regulatory environment did the data breach happen in?
