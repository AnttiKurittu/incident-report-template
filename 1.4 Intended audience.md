Describe who the report is written for. If the report is highly technical, define which technical experts would most benefit from reading it. Remember, that the intended audience is not necessarily the final audience - a report might be read in court, it might be circulated among top leadership in a company, or handed out to external experts for scrutiny.

Defining the intended audience will help readers understand the level of technical sophistication required to read the full report. Some parts, like the conclusions and the executive summary, should be understandable by all stakeholders, including non-technical people and experts in other lines of business than IT or security.
