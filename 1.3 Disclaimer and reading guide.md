# 1.3 Disclaimer and reading guide

This report has been written based on the facts found during an investigation into a cyber security incident. The investigation conclusions and findings are based on the materials delivered for inspection and discovered during the investigation. All findings in this report are subject to change if new evidence is discovered or presented to the investigation team.

## Timestamps

Unless otherwise stated, all timestamps are presented in [Coordinated Universal Time](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coordinated_Universal_Time) (UTC) following the [ISO 8601](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601) format. The timestamps follow the following general format: YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SSZ. The trailing Z signifies that the timestamp is presented in UTC. Standardizing on UTC allows the timestamps from globally dispersed systems to follow a common timeline. Some timestamps might be presented as a deviation from UTC when necessary (For example EET time stamps will be presented as UTC+2).

Example: 2024-10-04T11:15:12Z, 2024-10-04 11:15:12 (UTC+2)

## Statements of probability

All statements of fact are presented within a range of probability. The probability of all conclusions is based on the expertise of the investigation team and the quality of the evidence presented. Nothing in this report is presented with absolute certainty, especially conclusions that are reached due to the absence of evidence to the contrary. The following normalized statements will be used to convey the degree of certainty in any finding or conclusion:

| Chance percentage | Statement or wording                                                    |
| ----------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1-10%             | Very Unlikely, Almost certainly not, Very Improbable                    |
| 11-40%            | Not Likely, Unlikely, Improbable                                        |
| 41-60%            | Even Chance                                                             |
| 61-90%            | Probably or Likely, Strongly Suggested                                  |
| 90-99%            | Very Likely, Almost Certainly or Very Probably, Very Strongly Suggested |

## Statements of confidence

In addition to a statement of likelihood, a statement of confidence can be written. The statement of confidence is based on the subjective judgment of the investigation team on how the quality and amount of evidence affects the statement of likelihood. A confidence clause can be expressed using a three steps:

| Asserted with...  | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| ----------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| High Confidence   | The evidence strongly supports the statement, there is a large amount of evidence to point towards the conclusion and there is no evidence that would disprove the conclusion.                                                                                                                  |
| Medium Confidence | Asserted with Medium Confidence: The evidence supports the statement. The amount of evidence is sufficient, but other evidence could possibly surface that would question the conclusion. There might be evidence that would disprove the conclusion, but such evidence has not been presented. |
| Low Confidence    | Asserted with Low Confidence: There is missing evidence and major questions are left unanswered. A single piece of contrary evidence could disprove the claim, but it has not been found. The statement seems logical and can not be immediately disproven.                                     |

Example:

> On October 3rd, 2024, at approximately 14:32 UTC, XDR logs recorded suspicious activity originating from a laptop (`LAPTOP-E5SFX3`) assigned to a user in the marketing department. The logs showed an executable file `update.exe` being run from an uncommon directory (`C:\Users[username]\AppData\Roaming\Temp`). The sequence of events, combined with the file’s unusual behaviour, **strongly suggests** malicious activity.
> 
> The file executed from a temporary directory and attempted to connect to an external IP address known to host malicious content. Given these factors, it is **very likely** that `update.exe` is a malware executable attempting to establish communication with a command-and-control (C2) server. **This is stated with high confidence.**

## Investigators interpretation

The report text describes material findings that are based on the evidence presented. All conclusions, derivative theories or interpretations of facts are presented separately as a discrete quote. This quote will have the heading "Investigators interpretation", and it contains the subjective interpretation of the presented facts guided by the expertise, experience and skill of the investigation team or investigator. The interpretation is not presented as a material fact, but as an educated opinion.

Example:

> **Investigators Interpretation**
> 
> *It is likely that the malware originated from a malicious email received by the recipient on the Outlook desktop application. However, no email logs were present and the users inbox was deleted before the investigation, so it is not possible to verify this interpretation. However, the location where the malware was found is typically the location where Outlook stores downloaded attachments, and there are several forum posts on the internet describing similar attacks with email being the initial attack vector.
