1. Use clear, simple and careful language.
2. Avoid overly long or overly short sentences.
3. State only facts in the text body, leave the interpretations and conclusions to the "investigators interpretation" paragraphs.
4. Do not try to explain what a user did, explain instead what the user _account_ was observed doing.
5. Use a monospace font for all technical indicators, including program names, IP addresses, URLs, computer names, network locations, etc.
6. Present URL and IP's in a defanged format: hxxps://www[.]evilsite[.]com[:]8080.
7. Use a light background colour when taking screenshots. Disable dark mode for screenshots.
8. Use screenshots when possible. Remember that text in screenshots is not searchable, so copy-paste the text contents alongside the screenshot if possible.
9. Mask out personal information in the embedded image files using solid masks that are a part of the image file.
11. If a table or chart spans several pages, move it to an attachment. Instead of presenting the table, explain the table contents and refer to the attachment for full details.
12. When explaining anything that takes more than two steps, draw a diagram.
13. When attaching live malware samples, add a warning and compress the malware sample using password protection. Define the password in the report. If no password is specified, use default "`infected`" as the password. Some security tools will decrypt zip files with the default password and remove the malware sample, so using a different password is recommended.
14. Use [Markdown syntax](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/) to keep the report portable.
